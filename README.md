### Hi there, I'm Lisandro seia ðŸ‘‹ 

## I'm a Front-end developer.

Hi there! I'm a self-taught front-end developer with experience working with Node, React, Sass, APIs, Redux, MUI, and other technologies. As a self-motivated learner, I've honed my skills by building projects, participating in online communities, and keeping up with industry trends.

I've worked on a variety of projects, from small personal projects to large-scale applications, and I always strive to write clean, maintainable code that adheres to best practices. I'm particularly interested in creating intuitive user interfaces and exploring the intersection of design and development.

In my free time, you can usually find me tinkering with new frameworks or contributing to open-source projects. I enjoy collaborating with other developers and learning from their expertise, as well as sharing my own knowledge and insights.

I'm excited to continue growing as a developer and tackling new challenges, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together or just want to chat about code!
